# Domain Model

All classes live in `WebIde.Model`. The model is a pure class library with no framework dependencies — it can be referenced by any layer.

## Enums

### `DifficultyLevel`
Classifies problem difficulty.
```
Easy | Medium | Hard
```

### `SubmissionStatus`
Tracks the lifecycle of a code submission.
```
Pending → Running → Accepted
                  → WrongAnswer
                  → TimeLimitExceeded
                  → MemoryLimitExceeded
                  → CompileError
```

### `UserRole`
Controls what a user can do on the platform.
```
Admin | Instructor | Student
```

---

### `Submission`
One attempt by a user to solve a problem.

| Property | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Id | int | |
| SourceCode | string | required |
| Language | string | required — e.g. "cpp", "c" |
| Status | SubmissionStatus | |
| SubmittedAt | DateTime | |
| Score | int | 0–100, based on passing test cases |
| WallTimeMs | int | measured execution time |
| PeakMemoryKb | int | measured peak memory |
| User | User | required |
| Problem | Problem | required |
| ExecutionResult | ExecutionResult? | null while status is Pending/Running |

---

### `ExecutionResult`
Raw output from the sandbox for a submission.

| Property | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Id | int | |
| Stdout | string | required |
| Stderr | string | required |
| ExitCode | int | 0 = clean exit |
| TimedOut | bool | true if wall time exceeded limit |
| MemoryExceeded | bool | true if peak memory exceeded limit |

---

### `ProblemSet`
An ordered collection of problems — used for courses or curated playlists.

| Property | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Id | int | |
| Title | string | required |
| Description | string | required |
| CreatedAt | DateTime | |
| IsPublic | bool | controls visibility to non-members |

        string Stderr
        int ExitCode
        bool TimedOut
        bool MemoryExceeded
    }

    User             ||--o{ Submission    : "makes"
    User             }o--o{ Organization  : "belongs to"
    Organization     ||--o{ ProblemSet    : "owns"
    ProblemSet       }o--o{ Problem       : "contains"
    Problem          ||--o{ TestCase      : "has"
    Problem          ||--o{ Submission    : "receives"
    Problem          }o--o{ Tag           : "tagged with"
    Submission       ||--o| ExecutionResult : "produces"
```

Key relationships:
- **1-N**: Problem → TestCases, Problem → Submissions, User → Submissions, Organization → ProblemSets
- **N-N**: Problem ↔ Tag, Problem ↔ ProblemSet, User ↔ Organization
- `ExecutionResult` is nullable on `Submission` — it only exists after the sandbox has finished running
